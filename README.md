This repository contains two files: `collect_statistic.sh` and `statistic.py`.  
They can be used to collect statistics from a sequence of integers.

## Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <repo>
```


## Steps to run the scripts:

1. Ensure you have Python3 installed on your system.
2. Run the `collect_statistic.sh` script, passing the relative or full filename as an argument:

```sh
./collect_statistic.sh <filename>
```

3. You can also simply import and use the `collect_statistic()` function separately:

```python
collect_statistic([1, 2, 3])
```
